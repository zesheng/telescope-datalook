    <h3>What are "data-driven projects for social good"?</h3>
    <p>
      That’s a good question. Most digital projects use data in some form or another. A website of a non-profit organization that shows images could theoretically be called a "data-driven project for social good". But that's not what we mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started DataLook because we are fascinated by projects from two movements:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Using (open) data to solve civic problems (<a href="https://opengovdata.io/2014/civic-hacking/" target="_blank">Civic Hacking</a>, mostly web/mobile apps created by developers). An example project is <a href="/posts/gdB7dE4r9b6xeAMke">Adopt-a-hydrant</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using data science to solve social problems (<a href="http://carlshan.com/2015/01/08/data-science-social-good.html" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good</a>, mostly analytics-driven insight created by data scientists). An example project is <a href="/posts/cPSRTkJFSd4fCkbLe" target="_blank">Foodborne Chicago</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Other directories focus on <a href="http://digitalsocial.eu/" target="_blank">Digital Social Innovation</a>. That's basically anyone who uses the internet for social good. Or take the <a href="http://socialtech.org.uk/" target="_blank">Social Tech Guide</a>, featuring innovators that use technology to drive social change. The broader term is probably "<a href="http://www.grantcraft.org/assets/content/resources/blueprint_2015.pdf" target="_blank">digital civil society</a>". Some hashtags are #civichacking, #civictech, #tech4good, #data4good, #apps4good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field is broad (and awesome), so where does DataLook draw the line? Ultimately, we want to help you get engaged, contribute your coding or data science skills, replicate a project in your community, make the world a better place and feel good yourself. DataLook is not only a place to find information about cool projects, it's a call to action. Use DataLook to ask others how you can get involved. Gather or join a team, replicate a project or start a new one.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">
      We welcome all projects that use a minimum amount of data, that tackle real-world social problems in some community, and that are replicable (ideally open source).
    </p>

    <h3>Can I post a project?</h3>
    <p>
      Absolutely! Just sign in and hit the "<a href="{{pathFor 'post_submit'}}" target="_blank">Post a Project</a>" button. Each post needs:
    </p>
    <ul class="unstyled-list">
      <li>
        <span class="bold">URL:</span> Direct link to the project (whatever page has the best information for replication)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Title of the project:</span> if the project does not have a catchy title, you can use the organization's name (e.g., DataKind)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Tagline:</span> as short as possible, you can add the location in square brackets (we will have a separate field for the location soon)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Description (optional):</span> any additional information and links, not shown on the frontpage
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that our app supports <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> in the project description field.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the URL hasn't been posted before, it will be queued for approval. We approve your posts as quickly as possible.

    <h3>What if I'm looking for help with my project?</h3>
    <p>
      Very simple. Just use the "<a href="/category/help-us" target="_blank">Help us!</a>" category. In the description you should explain what needs to be done, the skills you are looking for and how people can get involved. Think about possibilities of remote collaboration (e.g., via Github).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Can I also submit stuff other than projects?</h3>
    <p>
      Let's see. Stuff like tutorials to learn coding or data science should be posted on other sites (e.g., <a href="http://www.datatau.com/" target="_blank">DataTau</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jobs related to the field can be posted for free. Just use the "<a href="/category/jobs" target="_blank">Jobs</a>" category.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not sure use the chat box on the bottom of the site, write us an <a href="mailto:tobias@datalook.io">email</a> or hit us up on <a href="https://twitter.com/datalook" target="_blank">@DataLook</a>. We are always happy to hear from you.

    <h3>How are projects ranked?</h3>
    <p>
      Default is <a href="/top">Top</a> sorting. Projects are then ranked by the time since submission, the number of upvotes (=stars), and other factors. You can also see <a href="/new">New</a> projects and <a href="/best">Most Starred</a> projects.

    <h3>What's the story of DataLook?</h3>
    <p>
      Pretty simple: We always missed such a site, went to a <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> in one of Germany's finest cities (Hamburg), launched the site, and kept going because we love what we do. We started out as Data for Good, but decided to go with DataLook. Just after launching, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/16/meet-data-for-good-the-hacker-news-for-showing-off-the-best-data-science-to-help-the-world/">VentureBeat</a> wrote a nice piece about us. We are also featured on <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/07/data-for-good-data-driven-projects-social-good.html">KDnuggets</a>.
